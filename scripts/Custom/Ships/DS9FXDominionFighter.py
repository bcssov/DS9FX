Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXDominionFighter.desc = "------- DESCRIPTION -------\nThe Jem\'Hadar attack ship is a small agile fighter, manned by a crew of a dozen Jem\'Hadar soldiers and a Vorta commander, normally found  operating in small hunter packs of 3 or more called \'wings\'. This provides a strong defense and a devastating attack to compensate for their  weak shields and hull. This ship is the staple of the Dominion Forces. It is a highly maneuverable attack fighter which has powerful weapons,  including Polaron weapons, which proved to be utterly superior to Federation Phasers and could penetrate shields. Following their unquestioning  loyalty to the Founders, Dominion attack ships will not withdraw from combat and have also shown the obedience to use their ship as a weapon by  ramming large slow enemy cruisers.\n\n------- TACTICS -------\nSince this ship specializes in group effort for strength, it is normally advised to be in packs of 3 or more fighters. In the case that you are  engaging an enemy ship alone, never retreat with this ship, since it\'s hull and shields are its weak point. Remember: Victory is Life.\n\n------- SHIP STATS -------\n\nHull Rating: 5000\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 2000 @ 4chg\n     Aft - 2000 @ 4chg\n     Dorsal - 2000 @ 4chg\n     Ventral - 2000 @ 4chg\n     Port - 2000 @ 4chg\n     Starboard - 2000 @ 4chg\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Speed - 11\n     Max Accel - 7\n     Max Ang Velocity - 1.5\n     Max Ang Accel - 1.5\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Warp - 9.8\n     Max Cruise Warp - 9.6\n\nCrew Complement: 13\n\n------- SHIP WEAPONS -------\n\nPhased Polaron Beam:\n   1xF \n     Max Chg - 0.5\n     Max Dmg - 2000\n     Min Firing Chg - 0.5\n     Rechg Rate - 1\n     Max Damage Distance - 100\n\nTorpedoes\n    2xF\n     Polaron - 60\n     Reload Delay - 15\n\n------- SHIP PROPERTIES -------\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nLife Support System:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n\nPhased Polaron Beam Emitter:\n     Max Condition - 2250\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\nPhased Polaron Beam System:\n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25  \n     Normal Power/Sec - 100\n\nRepair System:\n     Max Condition - 1200\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n     Maximum Repair Points - 45\n     Repair Teams - 1\n\nSensor Array:\n     Max Condition - 4500\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 100\n     Max # of Probes - 10\n     Sensor Base Range - 2000\n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 4500\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 250\n\nTorpedo Bays:\n   2xF\n     Max Condition - 1500\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition - 6600\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25  \n     Normal Power/Sec - 150\n\nTractor Beam Emitters:\n   1xF 1xA\n     Max Condition - 1200\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nTractor Beam System:\n     Max Condition - 1500\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 700\n\nWarp Core:\n     Max Condition - 4500\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Power Output/Sec - 1500\n     Main Battery Limit - 100000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 100000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 1300\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 500\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 6000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 100\n\n   Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 2250\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\n   Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 2250\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n \nWarp Engines:\n     Max Condition - 7500\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\n   Port Warp:\n     Max Condition - 3750\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\n   Star Warp:\n     Max Condition - 3750\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25"
