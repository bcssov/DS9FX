Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXBorgTacticalCube.desc = "------- DESCRIPTION -------\nThe Borg Class 4 tactical vessel was a type of heavily armed Borg cube utilized by the Borg Collective. The tactical cube differed from the standard Borg cube in several ways, the most notable being the extensive hull armor that covered a large portion of the exterior hull of the ship, as well as featuring significantly enhanced firepower and improved defences. The interior was also slightly altered from what is known of Borg \'architecture\'. The vessel\'s Central Plexus was protected by multi-regenerative security fields. Only one such vessel was observed, by Starfleet by USS Voyager in 2376. The tactical cube was caused to self-destruct by the Borg Queen during a brief civil war within the Collective.\n\n------- TACTICS -------\nTactics is futile. Seriously - when combatting this ship, just hope that you have a huge fleet and even still prepare your life as a drone as you will likely be very soon. When playing as the Tactical Cube, just sit back and have fun. \n\n------- SHIP STATS -------\n\nHull Rating: 500000\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 300000 @ 500chg\n     Aft - 300000 @ 500chg\n     Dorsal -
