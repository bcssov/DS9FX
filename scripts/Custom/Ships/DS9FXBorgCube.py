Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXBorgCube.desc = "------- DESCRIPTION -------\nThe archetypal Borg cube is a variety of immense, cubic starship that functions as part of the Borg Collective. The cube appears to be the principal spacefaring unit of the collective; it is by far the most common Borg craft. Borg cubes are designed as a combined weapons platform and factory. A colossal ship, it features several high power energy weapons, and has the ability to regenerate or repair itself after battle damage, almost instantaneously, including after direct phaser hits. Their main purpose was for destroying the military capacity of a species and assimilate the survivors into the Collective. The only unifying principles in the design of a cube are its shape, a decentralized/generalized arrangement, a size of several thousand meters per edge, and a hosting of tens or hundreds of thousands of drones. In terms of offense and defense, a Borg cube is a fleet in and of itself.  Common capabilities of cubes include high warp (transwarp) capabilities, self-regeneration and multiple redundant systems, rapid adaptability to almost any assault and various beam (tractor beams and cutting beams) and missile weapons. A single Borg cube has, on multiple occasions, taken on entire Federation fleets and held its own. Cubes have been commonly known to carry sphere ships in cavities covered by large slide-away hatches in the outermost layers.\n\n------- TACTICS -------\nBasically one function with this ship: destroy. There\'s no point in retreat, since this ship\'s weaponry is more than capable of destroying (or assimilating) fleets of starships. When engaging a Borg Cube it is advisable to disable its weapon systems or impulse, however you will need to disable its shield grid first. It is necessary to engage this vessel with your vessels maximum firepower and with a lot of support. Keep your distance to avoid being caught in a holding beam and to minimize the Cube\'s phaser damage, and be sure to rotate shields frequently.\n\n------- SHIP STATS -------\n\nHull Rating: 300000\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 100000 @ 120chg\n     Aft - 100000 @ 120chg\n     Dorsal - 100000 @ 120chg\n     Ventral - 100000 @ 120chg\n     Port - 100000 @ 120chg\n     Starboard - 100000 @ 120chg\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Speed - 9.7\n     Max Accel - 2\n     Max Ang Velocity - 0.01\n     Max Ang Accel - 0.01\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Warp - 9.99\n     Max Cruise Warp - 9.99\n\nCrew Complement: 5000\n\n------- SHIP WEAPONS -------\n\nEnergy Beams (single fire):\n   3xF 3xA 3xD 3xV 3xP 3xS    \n     Max Chg - 2\n     Max Dmg - 2000\n     Min Firing Chg - 2\n     Rechg Rate - 1.5\n     Max Damage Distance - 200\n\nPlasma Projectors (single fire):\n   2xF 2xA 2xD 2xV 2xP 2xS   \n     Max Chg - 2\n     Max Dmg - 3000\n     Min Firing Chg - 2\n     Rechg Rate - 1.5\n     Max Damage Distance - 200\n\nCutting Beams (single fire):\n   1xF 1xF 1xD 1xV 1xP 1xS\n     Max Chg - 2\n     Max Dmg - 3000\n     Min Firing Chg - 2\n     Rechg Rate - 1.5\n     Max Damage Distance - 200\n\nPlasma Cannons:\n   4xFP 4xFS 2xAP 2xAS\n     Max Chg - 15\n     Max Dmg - 500\n     Min Firing Chg - 15 \n     Rechg Rate - 1.5\n     Cooldown Time - 0.000001\n\nTorpedoes:\n   12xF 12xA 12xD 12xV 12xP 12xS  \n     Borg Warp Plasma - 25000\n     Reload Delay - 10\n\n\n------- SYSTEMS STATS -------\n\nBeam Arrays (Energy Beams):\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 3 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75 \n\nBeam Arrays (Plasma Projectors):\n     Max Condition - 3500\n     Repair Complexity - 3 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\nBeam Arrays (Cutting Beams):\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 4 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\nBeam System:\n     Max Condition - 75000\n     Repair Complexity - 4 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 500\n\nCortical Node 1:\n     Max Condition - 50000\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75 \n     Power Output/Sec - 20000\n     Main Battery Limit - 10000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 10000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 70000\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 20000\n\nCortical Node 2:\n     Max Condition - 50000\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75 \n     Power Output/Sec - 20000\n     Main Battery Limit - 10000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 10000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 70000\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 20000\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 300000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nPlasma Cannons:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75\n\nPlasma Cannon System:\n     Max Condition - 75000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75\n     Normal Power/Sec - 500\n\nRepair System:\n     Max Condition - 75000\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n     Maximum Repair Points - 700\n     Repair Teams - 9\n\nSensor Array (Primary):\n     Max Condition - 25000\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 100\n     Max # of Probes - 2500\n     Sensor Base Range - 5000\n\nSensor Array (Secondary):\n     Max Condition - 25000\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 100\n     Max # of Probes - 2500\n     Sensor Base Range - 5000\n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 100000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n     Normal Power/Sec - 1000\n\nTorpedo Bays:\n   2xF 2xA 2xD 2xV 2xP 2xS\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition - 75000\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 500\n\nTractor Beam Emitters:\n   2xF 2xA 2xD 2xV 2xP 2xS  \n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\nTractor Beam System:\n     Max Condition - 75000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 0\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 75000\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 500\n\n   Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\n   Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\nTranswarp Engines:\n     Max Condition - 75000\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 500\n\n   Port Transwarp:\n     Max Condition - 25000\n     Repair Complexity - 3.5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\n   Star Transwarp:\n     Max Condition - 25000\n     Repair Complexity - 3.5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5"
