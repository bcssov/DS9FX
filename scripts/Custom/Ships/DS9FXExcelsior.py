Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXExcelsior.desc = "------- DESCRIPTION -------\nThe Excelsior class was originally designed as a test bed for Starfleet\'s first experimental transwarp drive.  Having been sabotaged in  the engines\' first transwarp test and having failed in all subsequent attempts, the Excelsior prototype was refitted with a conventional  warp drive.  As full production started on the Excelsior class, the ship became the mainstay of the fleet in the late 23rd and early 24th  centuries, replacing the older Constitution class as the flagship class.  The Excelsior class remains in service today, more then 60 years  after if was first launched, through a program of continuous enhancements to the ships systems, being the personal flagship of choice for  many admirals.  By the 24th century, these ships were still in heavy use for virtually any mission, whether it be, scientific, diplomatic,  or offensive missions, the Excelsior-class is definitely a popular ship in Starfleet. \n\n------- TACTICS -------\nTake advantage of the number of phaser arrays on board Excelsior-class vessels when attacking enemy ships.  When attacking Excelsior class  vessels its wise to disable its shields as a priority, however do not under-estimate these class of ships.\n\n------- SHIP STATS -------\n\nHull Rating: 11000\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 9000 @ 11chg\n     Aft - 9000 @ 11chg\n     Dorsal - 9000 @ 11chg\n     Ventral - 9000 @ 11chg\n     Port - 9000 @ 11chg\n     Starboard - 9000 @ 11chg\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Speed - 6.9\n     Max Accel - 2\n     Max Ang Velocity - 0.4\n     Max Ang Accel - 0.3\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Warp - 9.2\n     Max Cruise Warp - 8.8\n\nCrew Complement: 750\n\n------- SHIP WEAPONS -------\n\nPhasers:\n   5xD 5xV 2xA\n     Max Chg - 1\n     Max Dmg - 500\n     Min Firing Chg - 1\n     Rechg Rate - 0.5\n     Max Damage Distance - 100\n\nTorpedoes:\n   6xF 2xA\n     Photon Type 6 - 200\n     Reload Delay - 30\n\n------- SHIP PROPERTIES -------\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 11000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nLife Support System:\n     Max Condition - 12500\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n\nPhaser Arrays:\n     Max Condition - 1000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nPhaser System:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 230\n\nRepair System:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.65\n     Maximum Repair Points - 75\n     Repair Teams - 4\n\nSensor Array:\n     Max Condition - 6000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 160\n     Max # of Probes - 8\n     Sensor Base Range - 4000\n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 9000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 600\n\nTorpedo Bays: \n   2xF 2xA\n     Max Condition - 2500\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75\n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 2 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75  \n     Normal Power/Sec - 130\n\nTractor Beam Emitters:\n   1xF 1xA\n     Max Condition - 1500\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\nTractor Beam System:\n     Max Condition - 1500\n     Repair Complexity - 7\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 600\n\nWarp Core:\n     Max Condition - 7550\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.3\n     Power Output/Sec - 1700\n     Main Battery Limit - 130000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 45000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 1700\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 160\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 120\n\n   Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\n   Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 2000 \n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\n   Port Warp:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\n   Star Warp:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n"
