Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXNeghvar.desc = "----- DESCRIPTION -----\nThe Negh\'Var is the Klingon Empire\'s newest ship design and flagship class, designed to showcase the military might of the Empire. It is also the most powerful ship ever produced by the Klingon Empire. The Negh\'Var can also carry 2500 troops and crew. Because of its mass and heavy armament, the Negh\'Var loses the high maneuverability of other Klingon ships. There can be only one purpose for this weapons platform, to take down planetary defenses and space station shields followed by the ability to transport thousands of Klingon warriors into battle. Due to the sheer size and advanced nature of the vessel, it is also the most expensive ship ever built by the Empire, meaning that while powerful, it will never replace the Vor\'cha for sheer usefulness. The Negh\'Var is slow-moving and sacrifices maneuverability for armor and weapons, making it a feared opponent in combat.\n\n----- TACTICS -----\nWhile battling against this ship, it is recommended at all costs to avoid the Forward Bow of the ship, as this is the location of most of its weapons. Take advantage of its slow maneuverability to attack at all costs. When using this ship, it should be used for base assaults, and if by chance you need to engage in starship combat, take full use of its Disruptor Beams.\n\n----- SHIP STATS -----\n\nHull Rating: 17500\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 16500 @ 17chg\n     Aft - 16500 @ 17chg\n     Dorsal - 16500 @ 17chg\n     Ventral - 16500 @ 17chg\n     Port - 16500 @ 17chg\n     Starboard - 16500 @ 17chg\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Speed - 6.9\n     Max Accel - 2\n     Max Ang Velocity - 0.1\n     Max Ang Accel - 0.1\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Warp - 9.6\n     Max Cruise Warp - 9.0\n\nCrew Complement: 2500\n\n----- SHIP WEAPONS -----\n\nDisruptor Cannons:\n   4xF\n     Max Chg - 5\n     Max Dmg - 100\n     Min Firing Chg - 1\n     Rechg Rate - 0.1\n     Cooldown Time - 1.5\n\nDisruptor Beams:\n   4xF 3xA 1xcD 1xV 1xP 1xS\n     Max Chg - 0.7\n     Max Dmg - 1000\n     Min Firing Chg - 0.7\n     Rechg Rate - 0.7\n     Max Damage Distance - 100\n\nTorpedoes: \n   6xF 6xA\n     Klingon Adv Photon - 500\n     Reload Delay - 45\n\n------- SHIP PROPERTIES -------\n\nCloaking System:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 6\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 1200\n\nDisruptor Beam Emitters:\n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nDisruptor Beam System:\n     Max Condition System - 2900 \n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 500\n\nDisruptor Cannons:\n     Max Condition - 2500\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\nDisruptor Cannon System:\n     Max Condition - 7200\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 400\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 17500\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nLife Support System:\n     Max Condition - 30000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n\nRepair System:\n     Max Condition - 1200\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n     Maximum Repair Points - 120\n     Repair Teams - 6\n\nSensor Array:\n     Max Condition - 6000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 250\n     Max # of Probes - 10\n     Sensor Base Range - 2500\n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 18000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 900\n\nTorpedo Bays:\n   2xF 2xA\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition - 5400\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 200\n\nTractor Beam Emitters:\n   1xF 1xA\n     Max Condition - 1500\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nTractor Beam System:\n     Max Condition - 3400\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 700\n\nWarp Core:\n     Max Condition - 14000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Power Output/Sec - 4500\n     Main Battery Limit - 250000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 150000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 4300\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 950\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 7000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 500\n\n   Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Aux Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Aux Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Condition - 12000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Port Warp:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Star Warp:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25"
