Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXWarbird.desc = "------- DESCRIPTION -------\nThe emergence of the massive D\'deridex-class Warbird in 2364, during an encounter with the USS Enterprise-D on the edge of the Neutral Zone, signaled the end of a fifty-three year Romulan isolation.  Over the next ten years, these Warbirds would participate in numerous encounters with Starfleet.  By 2374, they were also prominently featured in the Dominion War, where they were instrumental in forcing the Dominion fleets back time and again.  The class saw action during the First and Second Battles of Chin\'toka and the final showdown of the conflict, the Battle of Cardassia.  Despite their power, many ships of the class were destroyed by the Dominion.  The D\'deridex-class Warbird was one of the most advanced vessels in the Romulan Star Empire.  Warbirds are roughly twice as long as a Federation Galaxy-class starship, with an advantage in fire power, but a lower maximum speed and less combat manoeuvrability.  The primary emitter of a Warbird in located at its forward disruptor array, which also appears to be shared with a plasma torpedo launcher.  Like earlier Romulan ships, D\'deridex-class Warbirds were equipped with cloaking devices, which protect them from detection in most evasive situations.\n\n------- TACTICS -------\nTry to keep the enemies in front of you at all times, increasing power to engines to increase agility.  Use heavy plasma torpedoes against faster vessels but use advanced plasma carefully as they limited in supply.  When attacking a D\'deridex, keep away from the front and take out the cloak first, then take out the shields and hull.\n\n------- SHIP STATS -------\n\nHull Rating: 18000\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 16000 @ 12chg\n     Aft - 16000 @ 12chg\n     Dorsal - 16000 @ 12chg\n     Ventral - 16000 @ 12chg\n     Port - 16000 @ 12chg\n     Starboard - 16000 @ 12chg\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Speed - 7\n     Max Accel - 1.9\n     Max Ang Velocity - 0.15\n     Max Ang Accel - 0.15\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Warp - 9.6\n     Max Cruise Warp - 9.0\n\nCrew Complement: 1500\n\n------- SHIP WEAPONS -------\n\nDisruptor Beams:\n   1xF\n     Max Chg - 0.75\n     Max Dmg - 1500\n     Min Firing Chg - 0.75\n     Rechg Rate - 0.1\n     Max Damage Distance - 100\n\nPulse Disruptors:\n   2xFV 1xFP 1xFS \n   2xAD 2xAV 1xAP 1xAS \n     Max Chg - 3\n     Max Dmg - 350\n     Min Firing Chg - 1\n     Rechg Rate - 0.3\n     Cooldown Time - 0.1\n\nTorpedoes:\n   6xF\n     Flux Plasma Torp - 18\n     Plasma Torp - 500\n     Reload Delay - 45\n\n\n------- SYSTEMS STATS -------\n\nCloaking System:\n     Max Condition - 4500\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 1000\n\nDisruptor Emitter:\n   3xF\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\nDisruptor System:\n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 3 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n     Normal Power/Sec -  650\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 18000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nLife Support System:\n     Max Condition - 15000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n\nQuantum Singularity:\n     Max Condition - 11000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Power Output/Sec - 6500\n     Main Battery Limit - 700000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 400000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 7000\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 950\n\nPulse Disruptors:\n     Max Condition - 7000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nPulse Disruptor System:\n     Max Condition - 6000\n     Repair Complexity - 9 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Normal Power/Sec -  600\n\nRepair System:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n     Maximum Repair Points - 75\n     Repair Teams - 5\n\nSensor Array:\n     Max Condition - 7500\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.3\n     Normal Power/Sec - 500\n     Max # of Probes - 10\n     Sensor Base Range - 2500\n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 15000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 2000\n\nTorpedo Bays:\n   6xF\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.45 \n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition - 2200\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 650\n\nTractor Beam Emitters:\n   1xF 1xA 1xV  \n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\nTractor Beam System:\n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 3 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 500\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 1000\n\n   Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\n   Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\n   Port Warp:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Star Warp:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25"
