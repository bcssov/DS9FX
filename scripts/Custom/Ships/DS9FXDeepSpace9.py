Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXDeepSpace9.desc = "------- DESCRIPTION -------\nOld Cardassian mining station built in orbit of planet Bajor during the Cardassian Occupation. Deep Space 9 was built in 2346 by the Cardassians, who called the station Terok Nor, to exploit Bajor\'s rich uridium deposits. In 2369, the Cardassians relinquished their claim on Bajor and retreated from the region. Starfleet assumed control of the facility shortly thereafter, at the request of the Bajoran Provisional Government. Shortly thereafter, the Bajoran wormhole was discovered, linking the Bajoran sector to the Gamma Quadrant. Therefore, the station was moved closer to the wormhole. The Operations Center is where are all main station functions are monitored. The Promenade has numerous service facilities and stores, and three massive docking towers, and several smaller docking ports. In 2371, the station began a major upgrade of its defensive systems in anticipation of a feared Dominion invasion. These preparations were ultimately successful in defending the station from Gowron\'s fleet of Klingon Imperial warships. Equipped with multiple phaser banks and Photon Torpedo turrets, you would need a large fleet to bring their defenses down.\n\n------- TACTICS -------\nDeep Space Nine possesses multiple weapon systems, fast vessels are most likely to evade its barrage of photon torpedoes however are vulnerable to its phasers. Use long range attacks to increase chances of evading its weapons. The prime target should be to cripple its shield generators.\n\n------- SHIP STATS -------\n\nHull Rating: 300000\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 75000 @ 70chg\n     Aft - 75000 @ 70chg\n     Dorsal - 75000 @ 70chg\n     Ventral - 75000 @ 70chg\n     Port - 75000 @ 70chg\n     Starboard - 75000 @ 70chg\n\nRotational Thrusters:\n     Max Speed - 1\n     Max Accel - 0.1\n     Max Ang Velocity - 0.05\n     Max Ang Accel - 0.05\n\nCrew Complement: 975\n\n------- SHIP WEAPONS -------\n\nPhasers:\n   T1D, T2D, T3D,\n   T1V, T2V, T3V,\n   T1Upperx4, T1Lowerx4, \n   T2Upperx4, T2Lowerx4, \n   T3Upperx4, T3Lowerx4 \n     Max Chg - 1\n     Max Dmg - 1000\n     Min Firing Chg - 1\n     Rechg Rate - 0.75\n     Max Damage Distance - 1000\n\nTorpedoes: \n   Dx12 Vx12 Outerx12\n   T1Upperx8 T1Lowerx8\n   T2Upperx8 T2Lowerx8\n   T3Upperx8 T3Lowerx8,\n     Photon Type 6 - 5000\n     Reload Delay - 20\n     Reload Delay D, V - 30\n\n\n------- SYSTEMS STATS -------\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 300000\n     Repair Complexity - 10\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nDocking Ring 1:\n     Max Condition - 100000\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\nDocking Ring 2:\n     Max Condition - 100000\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\nDocking Ring 3:\n     Max Condition - 100000\n     Repair Complexity - 10\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nLife Support System:\n     Max Condition - 500000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n\nPhaser Arrays:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 7 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\nPhaser System:\n     Max Condition - 30000\n     Repair Complexity - 7\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 700\n\nPower Plant:\n     Max Condition - 300000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n     Power Output/Sec - 2000\n     Main Battery Limit - 400000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 200000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 2500\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 500\n\nRepair System:\n     Max Condition - 65000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n     Maximum Repair Points - 100\n     Repair Teams - 8\n\nSensor Array:\n     Max Condition - 130000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n     Normal Power/Sec - 300\n     Max # of Probes - 10\n     Sensor Base Range - 5000\n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 75000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n     Normal Power/Sec - 900\n\nTorpedo Bays:\n   3xD, 3xV, \n   T1Upperx2 T1Lowerx2 T1D T1V\n   T2Upperx2 T2Lowerx2 T2D T2V\n   T3Upper2x T3Lowerx2 T3D T3V\n   Outerx3\n     Max Condition - 7200\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition - 35000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 500\n\nTractor Beam Emitters:\n   T1, T2, T3   \n     Max Condition - 6000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\nTractor Beam System:\n     Max Condition - 6000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 100\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nRotational Thruster System:\n     Max Condition - 30000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 100\n\n   Thruster 1:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\n   Thruster 2:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\n   Thruster 3:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\n   Thruster 4:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\n   Thruster 5:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\n   Thruster 6:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5"
