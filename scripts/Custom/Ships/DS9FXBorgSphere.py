Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXBorgSphere.desc = "------- DESCRIPTION -------\nThis ship is mainly used for reconnaissance missions in the collective. The size and capabilities of Borg spheres appear to vary, based on observations made in various encounters with the Federation throughout the 2370s, as suggested by its designation as a \"long-range tactical vessel\" as well as its use as an auxiliary craft or scout ship.  It can be launched from the bigger Cube, and is also powerful, it requires quite a fleet to take it down as well. As a long-range vessel the Sphere is usually deployed against target vessels and station deemed to be of value but not of sufficient tactical threat to warrant the attention of a Cube.\n\n------- TACTICS -------\nThis ship is slow to maneuver, but has strong weapons for its size. Use the Warp Plasma Torpedoes alot as they are quite powerful and reload quickly. Also, take full advantage of the rapid fire Plasma Globule Cannos. When enaging the sphere try to target systems located on the edge of its hull and evade its torpedoes at all costs.\n\n------- SHIP STATS -------\n\nHull Rating: 75000\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 60000 @ 90chg\n     Aft - 60000 @ 90chg\n     Dorsal - 60000 @ 90chg\n     Ventral - 60000 @ 90chg\n     Port - 60000 @ 90chg\n     Starboard - 60000 @ 90chg\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Speed - 9.6\n     Max Accel - 1.9\n     Max Ang Velocity - 0.1\n     Max Ang Accel - 0.1 \n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Warp - 9.99\n     Max Cruise Warp - 9.99\n\nCrew Complement: 2000\n\n------- SHIP WEAPONS -------\n\nEnergy Beams (single fire):\n   4xD 4xV   \n     Max Chg - 2\n     Max Dmg - 1750\n     Min Firing Chg - 2\n     Rechg Rate - 1.5\n     Max Damage Distance - 200\n\nPlasma Projectors (single fire):\n   3xD 3xV   \n     Max Chg - 2\n     Max Dmg - 2000\n     Min Firing Chg - 2\n     Rechg Rate - 1.5\n     Max Damage Distance - 200\n\nCutting Beams (single fire):\n   1xFP 1xFS 1xAP 1xAS \n     Max Chg - 2\n     Max Dmg - 2250\n     Min Firing Chg - 2\n     Rechg Rate - 1.5\n     Max Damage Distance - 200\n\nPlasma Globule Cannons:\n   2xFP 2xFS 2xAP 2xAS\n     Max Chg - 15\n     Max Dmg - 200\n     Min Firing Chg - 15 \n     Rechg Rate - 1.5\n     Cooldown Time - 0.000001\n\nTorpedoes:\n   12xF 12xA 12xD 12xV     \n     Borg Warp Plasma - 5000  \n     Reload Delay - 10\n\n------- SYSTEMS STATS -------\n\nBeam Arrays (Energy Beams):\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 3 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75 \n\nBeam Arrays (Plasma Projectors):\n     Max Condition - 3500\n     Repair Complexity - 3 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\nBeam Arrays (Cutting Beams):\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 4 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\nBeam System:\n     Max Condition - 25000\n     Repair Complexity - 4 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 750\n\nCortical Node:\n     Max Condition - 75500\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n     Power Output/Sec - 20000\n     Main Battery Limit - 50000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 10000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 70000\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 20000\n\nDocking Bay:\n     Max Condition - 15000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 75000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nPlasma Globule Cannons:\n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75\n\nPlasma Globule Cannon System:\n     Max Condition - 25000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75\n     Normal Power/Sec - 1000\n\nRepair System:\n     Max Condition - 25000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n     Maximum Repair Points - 500\n     Repair Teams - 9\n\nSensor Array:\n     Max Condition - 7500\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 700\n     Max # of Probes - 1000\n     Sensor Base Range - 8000\n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 75000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n     Normal Power/Sec - 2000\n\nTorpedo Bays:\n   2xF 2xA 2xD 2xV\n     Max Condition - 1500\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - \n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition - 25000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75\n     Normal Power/Sec - 750\n\nTractor Beam Emitters:\n   2xF 1xA 1xP 1xS   \n     Max Condition - 1500\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\nTractor Beam System:\n     Max Condition - 25000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 25000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 1000\n\n   Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 7500\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\n   Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 7500\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\nTranswarp Engines:\n     Max Condition - 25000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\n   Port Transwarp:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 3.5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\n   Star Transwarp:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 3.5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5"
