Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXGalor.desc = "------- DESCRIPTION -------\nThe Cardassian Galor class composes the majority of the Cardassian Union\'s fleet.  Originally built to match the previous generation of  Federation and Klingon starships, the Galor class is easily outclassed by most other starships as the other Alpha Quadrant powers have  since advanced beyond the current level Cardassian technology.  To compensate for this short coming, the Cardassians often deployed ships  in small tactical groups composed of three or more Galor class ship.  Several of these ships were used during the war between the  Cardassians and the Federation in the late 2350s to early 2360s.  After Cardassia joined the Dominion, the Galor class was refitted with  more advance weapons to compete with similar class starships and were used on a much larger scale.  Even with these improvements, the  Galor class was consigned to a support role or cannon fodder for more powerful Dominion ships. After the defeat of the Dominion the future  of the Galor class is uncertain.\n \n------- TACTICS -------\nCertainly not the most powerful ship, it should be used in packs of a few at a time to ensure maximum efficiency in battles.  When  engaging this ship, target its primary subsystems as its shields do go down quickly and so do the underlying subsystems.\n\n------- SHIP STATS -------\n\nHull Rating: 7000\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 8000 @ 10chg\n     Aft - 8000 @ 10chg\n     Dorsal - 8000 @ 10chg\n     Ventral - 8000 @ 10chg\n     Port - 8000 @ 10chg\n     Starboard - 8000 @ 10chg\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Speed - 8.5\n     Max Accel - 3.9\n     Max Ang Velocity - 0.5\n     Max Ang Accel - 0.5\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Warp - 9.6\n     Max Cruise Warp - 8.9\n\nCrew Complement: 300\n\n------- SHIP WEAPONS -------\n\nCompressor Beams: (single fire)\n   1xF 1xFP 1xFS 1XA 1xAP 1xAS\n   3xD 2xV 1xP 1xS \n     Max Chg - 0.75\n     Max Dmg - 750\n     Min Firing Chg - 0.75\n     Rechg Rate - 0.75\n     Max Damage Distance - 75\n\nTorpedoes: \n   4xF\n     Cardassan Adv Photon - 200\n     Reload Delay - 30\n\n------- SHIP PROPERTIES -------\n\nCompressor Beam Emitters:\n     Max Condition - 2500\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nCompressor Beam System:\n     Max Condition - 800\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec -  150\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 7000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nLife Support System:\n     Max Condition - 17000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n\nRepair Systems:\n     Max Condition - 1000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n     Maximum Repair Points - 15\n     Repair Teams - 4\n\nSensor Array:\n     Max Condition - 1750\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 50\n     Max # of Probes - 10\n     Sensor Base Range - 1050\n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 6000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 200\n\nTorpedo Bays:\n   2xF\n     Max Condition - 2500\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition - 2500\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 50\n\nTractor Beam Emitters:\n   1xF 1xFV 1xAD 1xAV 1xS 1xP\n     Max Condition - 200\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\nTractor Beam System:\n     Max Condition System - 700\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 1\n     \nWarp Core:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Power Output/Sec - 650\n     Main Battery Limit - 190000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 70000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 650\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 200\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 1200\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 50\n\n   Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 1200\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 1200\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Port Warp:\n     Max Condition - 2500\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Star Warp:\n     Max Condition - 2500\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25"
