Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXKeldon.desc = "------- DESCRIPTION -------\nThe Cardassian Keldon class is based on the Galor class spaceframe and is a replacement for the aging Galor.  It is the ship of choice in the Cardassian fleet.  Weapon systems, shields, engines, and troop capacity have all been upgraded from the standard Galor class, though the Keldon class remains outclassed by more technologically advanced Alpha Quadrant power\'s starships.  Upgraded versions of the Keldon class were built by the Obsidian Order in the late 24th century.  The Keldon is a reliable ship, able to conduct all sorts of different mission profiles.  \n\n------- TACTICS -------\nIt is good to use its phaser arrays to full power, and make use of its improved warp and impulse engines.  When engaging this ship, be sure to target its shield generator, since the hull and adjacent subsystems aren\'t too strong.\n\n------- SHIP STATS -------\n\nHull Rating: 10000\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 10000 @ 10chg\n     Aft - 10000 @ 10chg\n     Dorsal - 10000 @ 10chg\n     Ventral - 10000 @ 10chg\n     Port - 10000 @ 10chg\n     Starboard - 10000 @ 10chg\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Speed - 7.9\n     Max Accel - 3\n     Max Ang Velocity - 0.5\n     Max Ang Accel - 0.5\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Warp - 9.6\n     Max Cruise Warp - 9.1\n\nCrew Complement: 500\n\n------- SHIP WEAPONS -------\n\nCompressor Beams: (single fire)\n   1xF 1xFP 1xFS 1XA 1xAP 1xAS\n   3xD 2xV 1xP 1xS \n     Max Chg - 0.75\n     Max Dmg - 750\n     Min Firing Chg - 0.75\n     Rechg Rate - 0.75\n     Max Damage Distance - 75\n\nTorpedoes: \n   4xF 2xA\n     Cardassan Adv Photon - 200\n     Reload Delay - 35\n     \n------- SHIP PROPERTIES -------\n\nCompressor Beam Emitters:\n     Max Condition - 2500\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25   \n\nCompressor Beam System:\n     Max Condition System - 800\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec -  150\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nLife Support System:\n     Max Condition - 20000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n\nRepair System:\n     Max Condition - 1000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n     Maximum Repair Points - 30\n     Repair Teams - 4\n\nSensor Array:\n     Max Condition - 1750\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Max # of Probes - 10\n     Normal Power/Sec - 50\n     Sensor Base Range - 1250\n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 6000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 200\n\nTorpedo Bays:\n   2xF 2xA\n     Max Condition - 1800\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25  \n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition System - 900\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 50\n\nTractor Beam Emitters:\n   1xF 1xFV 1xAD 1xAV 1xS 1xP\n     Max Condition - 200\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n\nTractor Beam System:\n     Max Condition System - 700\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 1\n     \nWarp Core:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Power Output/Sec - 900\n     Main Battery Limit - 200000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 70000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 750\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 250\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 1200\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 50\n\n   Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 1200\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 1200\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Port Impulse 2:\n     Max Condition - 1200\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Star Impulse 2:\n     Max Condition - 1200\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Port Warp:\n     Max Condition - 2500\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Star Warp:\n     Max Condition - 2500\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25"
