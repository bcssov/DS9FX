Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXAkira.desc = "------- DESCRIPTION -------\nThe Akira class is one of Starfleet\'s post Wolf 359 generation of ships. Designed to combat the Borg in any future encounter, the Akira is heavily armed. The Akira class was first battle tested during the second Borg invasion, where it proved invaluable to destroying the Borg cube. The Akira\'s second combat role came during the Dominion War, where it accounted for a good percentage of Federation firepower. Several Akira class vessels fought in the combined Alpha Quadrant fleet that invaded Cardassia in late 2374, and only three were destroyed by Cardassian Weapon Platforms at the Chin\'toka system. It\'s role as a battle cruiser has come in very handy for the Federation in times of battle. A formidable ship, equipped with a numerous amount of Photon Torpedo bays, it can definitely hold her own in battle. Akira class vessels were also refitted to launch Quantum torpedoes to further their role in combat. Unlike most other Federation vessels, the Akira class utilizes torpedo strikes as opposed to phaser engagements due to the limited phaser arrays.\n\n------- TACTICS -------\nDue to the limited amount of phaser arrays, the Akira class starships favour torpedo strikes in battle. Capable of launching a barrage of Photon torpedoes, the Akira class is a starship to contend with. When attacking Akira class vessels, it would be wise to disable its torpedo launchers as a priority to render the vessels primary attack useless.\n\n------- SHIP STATS -------\n\nHull Rating: 17500\n\nShield Rating: \n     Fore - 16500 @ 14chg\n     Aft - 16500 @ 14chg\n     Dorsal - 16500 @ 14chg\n     Ventral - 16500 @ 14chg\n     Port - 16500 @ 14chg\n     Starboard - 16500 @ 14chg\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Speed - 9\n     Max Accel - 5\n     Max Ang Velocity - 0.75 \n     Max Ang Accel - 0.75\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Warp - 9.8\n     Max Cruise Warp - 9\n\nCrew Complement: 500\n\n------- SHIP WEAPONS -------\n\nPhasers:\n   2xD 2xV\n     Max Chg - 1\n     Max Dmg - 1000\n     Min Firing Chg - 1\n     Rechg Rate - 0.5\n     Max Damage Distance - 100\n\nTorpedoes: \n   9xF 2xP 2xS\n     Quantum Type 1 - 45 \n     Photon Type 6 split 3 - 5\n     Photon Type 6 - 300\n     Reload Delay - 45\n     Reload Delay P,S - 30  \n\n------- SHIP PROPERTIES -------\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 17500\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nLife Support System:\n     Max Condition - 9520\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1 \n\nMain Hanger:\n     Max Condition - 1500\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75\n\nPhaser Arrays:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.3\n\nPhaser System:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.6\n     Normal Power/Sec - 50\n\nRepair System:\n     Max Condition - 24000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n     Maximum Repair Points - 100\n     Repair Teams - 6\n\nSensor Array:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled at Percentage - 0.3\n     Normal Power/Sec - 30\n     Max # of Probes - 10\n     Sensor Base Range - 2700\n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 16500\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 300\n\nShuttle Bay 1:\n     Max Condition - 1000\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75\n\nShuttle Bay 2:\n     Max Condition - 1000\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75\n\nTorpedo Bays:\n   8xF 2xP 2xS\n     Max Condition - 2200\n     Repair Complexity - 2 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.4\n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition - 24000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75\n     Normal Power/Sec - 200\n\nTractor Beam Emitters:\n   1xF 1xA\n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 7\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.3 \n\nTractor Beam System:\n     Max Condition - 24000\n     Repair Complexity - 1.5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75\n     Normal Power/Sec - 600\n\nWarp Core:\n     Max Condition - 9000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Power Output/Sec - 950\n     Main Battery Limit - 250000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 70000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 950\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 200\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 150\n\n   Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 2800\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.3 \n\n   Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 2800\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.3 \n\n   Port Impulse 2:\n     Max Condition - 2500\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.3 \n\n   Star Impulse 2:\n     Max Condition - 2500\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.3 \n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\n   Port Warp:\n     Max Condition - 6000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.3 \n\n   Star Warp:\n     Max Condition - 6000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.3"
