Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXDefiant.desc = "------- DESCRIPTION -------\nThe Defiant class is Starfleet\'s first true warship, though officially designated as an escort class. The Defiant design project was started after the initial Borg invasion, which left the Federation feeling vulnerable to future attack, on an extremely accelerated schedule. Designed from the ground up as an extremely maneuverable weapons platform featuring ablative armour, quantum torpedoes, and rapid fire pulse phasers, the Defiant class is Starfleet\'s premier class. As threats of the Borg diminished, the Defiant program was scrapped after the ship proved to have excessive power and weapons problems. With the coming of the Dominion threat, the USS Defiant was stationed at DS9 to hold the Dominion at bay until reinforcement could arrive. The ship possess minimal crew accommodations, a small sickbay, and no provisions for families, and carried at least 2 shuttlecraft. It was also equipped with a class-7 warp drive, which was exceptionally powerful, and a cloaking device. The USS Defiant was pivotal during the Dominion war, however the prototype was destroyed by the Breen towards the end of the war. The second Defiant Class vessel (USS Sao Paulo) was named USS Defiant in its predecessor\'s honour. Defiant class starships are considered as destroyer class vessels and pose a considerable threat.\n\n------- TACTICS -------\nAlthough heavily shielded for its size, the Defiant class cannot take sustained firepower from the opponents it is designed to face. Use its high maneuverability to avoid enemy fire, and try to maintain pulse phaser fire to a single shield. When attacking Defiant class vessels, it is necessary to evade its pulse phasers. Disabling the vessels impulse engines would greatly increase chances of success.\n\n------- SHIP STATS -------\n\nAblative Armor Rating: 5000\n\nHull Rating: 10500\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 8500 @ 14chg\n     Aft - 8500 @ 14chg\n     Dorsal - 8500 @ 14chg\n     Ventral - 8500 @ 14chg\n     Port - 8500 @ 14chg\n     Starboard - 8500 @ 14chg\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Speed - 9.9\n     Max Accel - 6.9\n     Max Ang Velocity - 1.2 \n     Max Ang Accel - 0.7\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Warp - 9.98\n     Max Cruise Warp - 9.2\n\nCrew Complement: 50\n\n------- SHIP WEAPONS -------\n\nPhasers:\n   1xPV 1xSV 1xD\n     Max Chg - 0.5	\n     Max Dmg - 2000\n     Min Firing Chg - 0.5 \n     Rechg Rate - 0.75\n     Max Damage Distance - 100 \n\nPulse Phasers:\n   4xF\n     Max Chg - 12\n     Max Dmg - 100\n     Min Firing Chg - 5 \n     Rechg Rate - 0.9\n     Cooldown Time - 0.09\n\nTorpedoes:\n   4xF 2xA\n     Type 3 Quantum - 60\n     Type 9 Photon - 60\n     Type 6 Photon - 80\n     Type 6 Photon split 10 - 2\n     Reload Delay - 25\n\n------- SHIP PROPERTIES -------\n\nAblative Armor:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 9\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\nCloaking System:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 7\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75\n     Normal Power/Sec - 500\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 10500\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nLife Support System:\n     Max Condition - 15000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n\nPhaser Arrays:\n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 4 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75 \n\nPhaser System:\n     Max Condition - 4800\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75  \n     Normal Power/Sec - 100\n\nPulse Phaser Emitters:\n     Max Condition - 3200\n     Repair Complexity - 3 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75   \n\nPulse Phaser System:\n     Max Condition - 4800\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 80\n\nRepair System:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n     Maximum Repair Points - 34\n     Repair Teams - 2\n\nSensor Array:\n     Max Condition - 12000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 75\n     Max # of Probes - 5\n     Sensor Base Range - 1800\n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 180\n\nShuttle Bay:\n     Max Condition - 800\n     Repair Complexity - 2 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\nTorpedo Bays:\n   2xF 1xA\n     Max Condition - 3200\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75 \n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 50\n\nTractor Beam Emitters:\n   1xF 1xA\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\nTractor Beam System:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 550\n\nWarp Core:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Power Output/Sec - 500\n     Main Battery Limit - 200000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 400000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 600\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 50\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 50\n\n   Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\n   Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5  \n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75 \n\n   Port Warp:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75 \n\n   Star Warp:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 3 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75"
