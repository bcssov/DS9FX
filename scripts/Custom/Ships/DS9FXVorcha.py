Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXVorcha.desc = "----- DESCRIPTION -----\nThe Klingon Vor\'cha class was first introduced in the mid-24th century as a replacement for the aging K\'t\'inga class and makes up the bulk of the Klingon fleet. Since then, it has become the standard Klingon battle cruiser design. Due to its versatility, the Vor\'cha is tasked with numerous roles in the Klingon Empire. While it is the primary assault vessel of the Klingon Military during wartime, it is also equipped with a cloaking device and advanced long-range sensor systems, allowing it to be quite effective as an exploratory and reconnaissance vessel. The Vor\'cha can also transport 1500 Klingon troops and crew.\n\n----- TACTICS -----\nThe Vor\'cha is a powerful ship, the ship of choice in the Empire. Make use of the Vor\'cha\'s forward weapons array to deliver a fast and volatile attack on your opponent. When attacking this ship, try to take out its torpedoes, as that is its main weapon in this case, and take out their engines as well, because for a ship of its size, it is surprisingly maneuverable.\n\n----- SHIP STATS -----\n\nHull Rating: 15000\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 12500 @ 12chg\n     Aft - 12500 @ 12chg\n     Dorsal - 12500 @ 12chg\n     Ventral - 12500 @ 12chg\n     Port - 12500 @ 12chg\n     Starboard - 12500 @ 12chg\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Speed - 7.9\n     Max Accel - 3\n     Max Ang Velocity - 0.3\n     Max Ang Accel - 0.3\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Warp - 9.6\n     Max Cruise Warp - 9.0\n\nCrew Complement: 1900\n\n----- SHIP WEAPONS -----\n\nDisruptor Cannons:\n   4xF\n     Max Chg - 5\n     Max Dmg - 100\n     Min Firing Chg - 1\n     Rechg Rate - 0.1\n     Cooldown Time - 5\n\nDisruptor Beams: (single fire)\n   1xF 2xA 1xD 1xV 1xP 1xS\n     Max Chg - 0.5\n     Max Dmg - 1500\n     Min Firing Chg - 0.5\n     Rechg Rate - 1\n     Max Damage Distance - 80\n\nTorpedoes: \n   6xF 5xA\n     Klingon Adv Photon - 500\n     Reload Delay - 30\n\n------- SHIP PROPERTIES -------\n\nCloaking System:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 6\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 1200\n\nDisruptor Beam Emitters:\n     Max Condition - 1000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nDisruptor Beam System:\n     Max Condition System - 1600 \n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 500\n\nDisruptor Cannons:\n     Max Condition - 1500\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\nDisruptor Cannon System:\n     Max Condition - 5200\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 400\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 15000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 6000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 100\n\nLife Support System:\n     Max Condition - 25000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n\nRepair System:\n     Max Condition - 900\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n     Maximum Repair Points - 60\n     Repair Teams - 4\n\nSensor Array:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 250\n     Max # of Probes - 10\n     Sensor Base Range - 2200\n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 900\n\nTorpedo Bays:\n   2xF 1xA\n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition - 4400\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 200\n\nTractor Beam Emitters:\n   1xF 1xFD 1xA\n     Max Condition - 1500\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nTractor Beam System:\n     Max Condition - 2400\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 700\n\nWarp Core:\n     Max Condition - 7000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Power Output/Sec - 4500\n     Main Battery Limit - 320000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 200000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 4500\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 700\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 6000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 500\n\n   Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Port Warp:\n     Max Condition - 7000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Star Warp:\n     Max Condition - 7000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25"
