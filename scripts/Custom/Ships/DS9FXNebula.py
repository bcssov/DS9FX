Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXNebula.desc = "------- DESCRIPTION -------\nThe Nebula class starship is closely related to that of the Galaxy-class, aqnd contains many of the same elements and weaponry.  This class, however, is a bit weaker in overall strength.  The engineering section houses a pod structure that can be used in various configurations.  Nebula class starships have been observed carrying pods that contain additional warp nacelles, sensor platforms, and torpedo launchers.  The construction of a Nebula class starship takes much less time than a Galaxy class, so there are more of them active in Starfleet. \n\n------- TACTICS -------\nThis Nebula class vessel is equipped with a large number of torpedo tubes due to its weapons pod.  Take advantage of this when engaging enemy ships.  When attacking this Nebula class, it is wise to disable its torpedo system initially.\n\n------- SHIP STATS -------\n\nHull Rating: 15000\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 10000 @ 15chg\n     Aft - 10000 @ 15chg\n     Dorsal - 10000 @ 15chg\n     Ventral - 10000 @ 15chg\n     Port - 10000 @ 15chg\n     Starboard - 10000 @ 15chg\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Speed - 7.9\n     Max Accel - 1.9\n     Max Ang Velocity - 0.5 \n     Max Ang Accel - 0.25\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Warp - 9.9\n     Max Cruise Warp - 9\n\nCrew Complement: 750\n\n------- SHIP WEAPONS -------\n\nPhasers:\n   3xD 3xV 1xP 1xAP 1xAS 1xS 1xP\n     Max Chg - 1\n     Max Dmg - 600\n     Min Firing Chg - 1\n     Rechg Rate - 0.6\n     Max Damage Distance - 100\n\nTorpedoes:\n   8xF 6xA 1xP 1xS\n     Photon Type 6 - 500\n     Photon Type 6 split 3 - 5\n     Reload Delay - 60\n\n------- SHIP PROPERTIES -------\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 15000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nLife Support System:\n     Max Condition - 11000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n\nMain Bridge:\n     Max Condition - 15000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nMain Shuttle Bay:\n     Max Condition - 2000 \n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nPhaser Arrays:\n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nPhaser System:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 7\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25  \n     Normal Power/Sec - 300\n\nRepair System:\n     Max Condition - 12000\n     Repair Complexity - 2 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n     Maximum Repair Points - 50\n     Repair Teams - 4\n\nSensor Array:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 100\n     Max # of Probes - 10\n     Sensor Base Range - 3000\n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 400\n\nShuttle Bay:\n     Max Condition - 2000 \n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nTorpedo Bays:\n   6xF 3xA 1xP 1xS\n     Max Condition - 2400\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 100\n\nTractor Beam Emitters:\n   2xF 2xA\n     Max Condition - 2500\n     Repair Complexity - 7\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nTractor Beam System:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 7\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 600\n\nWarp Core:\n     Max Condition - 7000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Power Output/Sec - 2500\n     Main Battery Limit - 250000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 80000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 2000\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 200\n\nWeapons Pod:\n     Max Condition - 18000 \n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 150\n\n   Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\n   Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\n   Port Warp:\n     Max Condition - 7000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\n   Star Warp:\n     Max Condition - 7000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 "
