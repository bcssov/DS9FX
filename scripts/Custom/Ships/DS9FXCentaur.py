Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXCentaur.desc = "------- DESCRIPTION -------\nThe Centaur type class was a relatively new starship created in the late 2360\'s, with a design consisting of an Excelsior class saucer section with warp nacelles mounted on the primary hull and a weapons pod.  The Centaur was intended as a successor to the aging Miranda-class starships, and whose primary role was as a fast attack ship with excellent maneuverability when relieved of the bulk of the Excelsior\'s secondary hull.  The Centaur was designed as a replacement for the huge number of destroyers and other small combatant vessels operated by the Federation.  The ship was designed from the beginning as an escort, and was designed just before the Ambassador class cruiser, to operate along with Excelsior class cruisers and later the Ambassador class itself.  The class did not replace some of the larger classes.  The Centaur class is the forerunner in many ways of the Saber class escorts but is much larger.  Many of the hulls of the Centaur class are beginning to age but due to the Dominion war, none of the vessels are planned for decommissioning.  Like the Excelsior class, the Centaur class was designed with large warp engines.  The development of the design was first started when the Excelsior was being constructed and was originally planned with Trans-Warp drives.  The large engine nacelles were retained after the class reverted to more conventional warp drives.\n\n------- TACTICS -------\nWhen engaging enemy ships, try to prevent damage to the ships shield generator and continue to rotate through all phaser arcs.  The ship iteself is able to hold its own against most starships, however its advisable to take away an enemy ships advantage as a priority.  When attacking Centaur class vessels, you should disable its impulse engines allowing you to target the vessel with torpedoes more easily.\n\n------- SHIP STATS -------\n\nHull Rating: 12000\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 7500 @ 7chg\n     Aft - 7500 @ 7chg\n     Dorsal - 7500 @ 7chg\n     Ventral - 7500 @ 7chg\n     Port - 7500 @ 7chg\n     Starboard - 7500 @ 7chg\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Speed - 8.5\n     Max Accel - 4\n     Max Ang Velocity - 0.75\n     Max Ang Accel - 0.75\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Warp - 9.6\n     Max Cruise Warp - 9\n\nCrew Complement: 315\n\n------- SHIP WEAPONS -------\n\nPhasers:\n   5xD 5xV 2xA\n     Max Chg - 1\n     Max Dmg - 500\n     Min Firing Chg - 1\n     Rechg Rate - 0.25\n     Max Damage Distance - 60\n\nTorpedoes: \n   4xF 2xA\n     Photon Type 6 - 300\n     Reload Delay - 40\n\n------- SHIP PROPERTIES -------\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 12000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 120\n\nLife Support System:\n     Max Condition - 9500\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n\nMain Bridge:\n     Max Condition - 9000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nPhaser Arrays:\n     Max Condition - 1000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nPhaser System:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 230\n\nRepair System:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.01\n     Maximum Repair Points - 75\n     Repair Teams - 5\n\nSensor Array:\n     Max Condition - 6000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled at Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 160\n     Max # of Probes - 8\n     Sensor Base Range - 3500\n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 9000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 600\n\nTorpedo Bays:\n   2xF 2xA\n     Max Condition - 2500\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 130\n\nTractor Beam Emitters:\n   1xF 1xA\n     Max Condition - 1500\n     Repair Complexity - 7\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nTractor Beam System:\n     Max Condition - 1500\n     Repair Complexity - 7\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 600\n\nWarp Core:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Power Output/Sec - 1600\n     Main Battery Limit - 130000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 45000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 1500\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 200\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 120\n\n   Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Port Warp:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Star Warp:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25"
