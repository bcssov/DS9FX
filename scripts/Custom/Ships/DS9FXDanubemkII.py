Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXDanubemkII.desc = "------- DESCRIPTION -------\nThe Danube class resembles a large shuttlecraft and are informally called runabouts. They are multi-role vessels used for short-range movement  of personnel and supplies. They have a cockpit that incorporates a short range two-person transporter. The midsection was a detachable module  which could be used for different missions. Assigned to large starships and deep space outposts, including starbases like Deep Space Nine,  runabouts allow for the operation of local exploratory and diplomatic missions around their assigned region without the need for calling in or  diverting a larger starship. Observed Danube class runabouts are named after rivers on Earth. Similar to the MKI Runabout, the MKII has an  extra rollbar in the midsection which carries double the number of Photon Torpedoes. This is definitely an advantage during a combat mission,  and is definitely the craft of choice for short range tactical missions.\n\n------- TACTICS -------\nAs would be expected, a vessel of this size does not pose a great threat when isolated. However, in packs of three or more, or supporting  larger starships, they can prove effective as combat support vessels. When attacking Danube Class vessels, a successful torpedo strike should  be enough to knock out its shield vector allowing phasers to destroy the hull.\n\n------- SHIP STATS -------\n\nHull Rating: 3000\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 5000 @ 5chg\n     Aft - 5000 @ 5chg\n     Dorsal - 5000 @ 5chg\n     Ventral - 5000 @ 5chg\n     Port - 5000 @ 5chg \n     Starboard - 5000 @ 5chg\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Speed - 9\n     Max Accel - 4\n     Max Ang Velocity - 1\n     Max Ang Accel - 1\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Warp - 5.7\n     Max Cruise Warp - 5\n\nCrew Complement: 4\n\n------- SHIP WEAPONS -------\n\nPhasers:\n   2xF 2xA 1xP 1xS\n     Max Chg - 0.75\n     Max Dmg - 500\n     Min Firing Chg - 0.75 \n     Rechg Rate - 1\n     Max Damage Distance - 100 \n\nTorpedoes:\n   4xF\n     Photon Type 6 - 30\n     Reload Delay - 30\n\n------- SYSTEMS STATS -------\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nLife Support System:\n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n\nPhaser Arrays:\n     Max Condition - 300\n     Repair Complexity - 1  \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5  \n\nPhaser System:\n     Max Condition - 1200\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5  \n     Normal Power/Sec - 50\n\nRepair System:\n     Max Condition - 800\n     Repair Complexity - 4 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5  \n     Maximum Repair Points - 1\n     Repair Teams - 1\n\nSensor Array:\n     Max Condition - 600\n     Repair Complexity - 3 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 50\n     Max # of Probes - 1\n     Sensor Base Range - 1500 \n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 800\n     Repair Complexity - 3 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 75\n\nTorpedo Bays:\n   2xF 2xRollbar\n     Max Condition - 400\n     Repair Complexity - 3 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition - 1000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 50\n\nWarp Core:\n     Max Condition - 1000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Power Output/Sec - 500\n     Main Battery Limit - 30000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 3000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 550\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 50\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 1000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 100\n\n   Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 600\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\n   Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 600\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5  \n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Condition - 1600\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\n   Port Warp:\n     Max Condition - 500\n     Repair Complexity - 3 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\n   Star Warp:\n     Max Condition - 500\n     Repair Complexity - 3 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 "
