Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXMiranda.desc = "------- DESCRIPTION -------\nThe Miranda-class starship, such as the USS Reliant destroyed by the Enterprise-A, was a type of light cruiser introduced by Starfleet in  the late 23rd century.  The configuration of the Miranda class shares a similar design lineage and features with the Constitution class  implemented in 2270.  These ships typically performed patrol and survey assignments.  Despite the small size, the class performed  satisfactorily well into the 24th century, with the oldest members of this class continuing their service lifetimes as transports.   Several series of the ships were produced throughout the 23rd and 24th centuries, with many still serving in the fleet through the  mid-2370s.  These vessels notably served in a large number of engagements during the Dominion War, many were subsequently lost.\n\n------- TACTICS -------\nEngage enemy ships with the support of other vessels whenever possible.  While the Miranda class is somewhat outdated, it is still capable  of defending itself against weaker vessels.  Rotate through its phasers and keep your distance to decrease torpedo impacts.  When  attacking the Miranda class, several torpedo volleys to hits hull should be sufficient to deal considerable damage.\n\n------- SHIP STATS -------\n\nHull Rating: 9000\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 8000 @ 11chg\n     Aft - 8000 @ 11chg\n     Dorsal - 8000 @ 11chg\n     Ventral - 8000 @ 11chg\n     Port - 8000 @ 11chg\n     Starboard - 8000 @ 11chg\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Speed - 9\n     Max Accel - 4\n     Max Ang Velocity - 0.5\n     Max Ang Accel - 0.5\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Warp - 9.2\n     Max Cruise Warp - 8\n\nCrew Complement: 220\n\n------- SHIP WEAPONS -------\n\nPhasers:\n   3xD 3xV \n     Max Chg - 1 \n     Max Dmg - 700\n     Min Firing Chg - 1\n     Rechg Rate - 0.7\n     Max Damage Distance - 100\n\nCompression Phasers:\n   2xF 2xA\n     Max Chg - 1\n     Max Dmg - 1000\n     Min Firing Chg - 1\n     Rechg Rate - 0.7\n     Max Damage Distance - 100\n\nTorpedoes:\n   2xF 2xA \n     Photon Type 6 - 300\n     Reload Delay - 20\n\n------- SHIP PROPERTIES -------\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 9000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nLife Support System:\n     Max Condition - 9000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1 \n\nPhaser Arrays:\n     Max Condition - 1000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nPhaser System:\n     Max Condition - 3400\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25  \n     Normal Power/Sec - 100\n\nRepair System:\n     Max Condition - 6000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1 \n     Maximum Repair Points - 70\n     Repair Teams - 4\n\nSensor Array:\n     Max Condition - 5500\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 150\n     Max # of Probes - 8\n     Sensor Base Range - 3000 \n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 5500\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 250\n\nShuttlebay 1:\n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25  \n\nShuttlebay 2:\n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25  \n\nTorpedo Bays:\n   2xF 2xA\n     Max Condition - 2600\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition - 2000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 50\n\nTractor Beam Emitters:\n   1xF 1xA\n     Max Condition - 2500\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\nTractor Beam System:\n     Max Condition - 2500\n     Repair Complexity - 5\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 600\n\nWarp Core:\n     Max Condition - 6000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Power Output/Sec - 750\n     Main Battery Limit - 100000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 25000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 700\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 100\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 4000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n     Normal Power/Sec - 25\n\n   Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 2 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\n   Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 2\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25  \n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Condition - 6000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n\n   Port Warp:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25\n\n   Star Warp:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25"
