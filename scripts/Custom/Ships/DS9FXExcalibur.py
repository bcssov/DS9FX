Foundation.ShipDef.DS9FXExcalibur.desc = "------- DESCRIPTION -------\nDefinitely the largest space vehicle constructed by the Federation Starfleet, this ship was mainly built to combat the equally large and powerful Cardassian Hutet. Equipped with powerful modulating shields, heavy phaser banks, Quantum Torpedo launchers as well as Quantum Torpedo turrets - this ship is a force to be reckoned with.\n\n------- TACTICS -------\nWhen attacking with the Excalibur take advantage of its Quantum torpedo turrets which are capable of massive damage yields. Its slow speed makes the ship vulnerable to fast attack vessels which means additional support may be required. However larger ships will be extremely vulnerale to its torpedoes and heavy phaser arrays. Attack the Excalibur in larger numbers and avoid its torpedo tubes, it would be wise to disable its engines to ensure the vessel cannon maneuver into firing position and further reduce its greatest weakness.\n\n------- SHIP STATS -------\n\nHull Rating: 30000\n\nShield Rating:\n     Fore - 20000 @ 20chg\n     Aft - 20000 @ 20chg\n     Dorsal - 20000 @ 20chg\n     Ventral - 20000 @ 20chg\n     Port - 20000 @ 20chg\n     Starboard - 20000 @ 20chg\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Speed - 6.9\n     Max Accel - 1.9\n     Max Ang Velocity - 0.25 \n     Max Ang Accel - 0.2\n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Warp - 9.9\n     Max Cruise Warp - 9.7\n\nCrew Complement: 2500\n\n------- SHIP WEAPONS -------\n\nPhasers:\n   2xD 3xV\n     Max Chg - 1.5\n     Max Dmg - 1500\n     Min Firing Chg - 1\n     Rechg Rate - 1\n     Max Damage Distance - 100 \n\nTorpedoes:\n   6xF 6xA\n     Type 3 Quantum  - 750\n     Reload Delay - 60\n\nQuantum Torpedo Turrets: \n   1xV 1xP 1xS\n     Max Chg - 5\n     Max Dmg - 1200\n     Min Firing Chg - 1\n     Rechg Rate - 0.1\n     Cooldown Time - 10\n\n------- SYSTEMS STATS -------\n\nHull:\n     Max Condition - 30000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nLife Support System:\n     Max Condition - 65000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.1\n\nPhaser Arrays:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 5 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\nPhaser System:\n     Max Condition - 9500\n     Repair Complexity - 1 \n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5  \n     Normal Power/Sec - 1500\n\nRepair System:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n     Maximum Repair Points - 350\n     Repair Teams - 9\n\nSensor Array:\n     Max Condition - 7500\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 1250\n     Max # of Probes - 10\n     Sensor Base Range - 3000\n\nShield Generator:\n     Max Condition - 20000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 2000\n\nShuttle Bay 1:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nShuttle Bay 2:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nShuttle Bay 3:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nShuttle Bay 4:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0\n\nTorpedo Bays:\n   2xF 1xA\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\nTorpedo System:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 500\n\nTorpedo Turrets:\n     Max Condition - 3000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\nTorpedo Turret System:\n     Max Condition - 5000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n     Normal Power/Sec - 1000\n\nTractor Beam Emitters:\n   2xF 1xD 1xV\n     Max Condition - 2000 \n     Repair Complexity - 7\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.75\n\nTractor Beam System:\n     Max Condition - 7000\n     Repair Complexity - 6\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 800\n\nWarp Core:\n     Max Condition - 17000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.25 \n     Power Output/Sec - 9500\n     Main Battery Limit - 800000\n     Backup Battery Limit - 350000\n     Main Conduit Capacity - 9500\n     Backup Battery Capacity - 1000\n\n------- ENGINE PROPERTIES -------\n\nImpulse Engines:\n     Max Condition - 9000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5\n     Normal Power/Sec - 2250\n\n   Port Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\n   Star Impulse:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 3\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5  \n\nWarp Engines:\n     Max Condition - 8000\n     Repair Complexity - 1\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\n   Port Warp:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5 \n\n   Star Warp:\n     Max Condition - 10000\n     Repair Complexity - 4\n     Disabled Percentage - 0.5"
